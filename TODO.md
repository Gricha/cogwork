# Future Improvements

## Accessor Libraries

Create wrapper packages for different integration patterns:
- **MCP server** - Expose game engine as MCP tools
- **API** - HTTP/REST wrapper for web integrations
- **CLI** - Reusable terminal REPL (extract from examples)

These would all wrap the core cogwork API, reducing boilerplate for consumers.
